# Calculus Differentiation Program

## Overview
This program is designed to assist users in performing differentiation operations on various mathematical functions. Utilizing the SymPy library, it allows for the differentiation of trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, implicit functions, and second-order derivatives.

## Features
- **Trigonometric Differentiation**: Differentiate common trigonometric functions such as sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), and their reciprocals.
- **Inverse Trigonometric Differentiation**: Differentiate inverse trigonometric functions like arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x), and others.
- **Logarithmic Differentiation**: Differentiate natural logarithm ln(x) and logarithm with a specified base.
- **Implicit Differentiation**: Calculate the derivative dy/dx for equations involving both x and y.
- **Second-Order Derivatives**: Compute the second derivative of selected functions.
