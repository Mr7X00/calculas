# Calculus Differentiation Program

## Overview
This program is designed to assist users in performing differentiation operations on various mathematical functions. Utilizing the SymPy library, it allows for the differentiation of trigonometric functions, inverse trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, implicit functions, and second-order derivatives.

## Features
- **Trigonometric Differentiation**: Differentiate common trigonometric functions such as sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), and their reciprocals.
- **Inverse Trigonometric Differentiation**: Differentiate inverse trigonometric functions like arcsin(x), arccos(x), arctan(x), and others.
- **Logarithmic Differentiation**: Differentiate natural logarithm ln(x) and logarithm with a specified base.
- **Implicit Differentiation**: Calculate the derivative dy/dx for equations involving both x and y.
- **Second-Order Derivatives**: Compute the second derivative of selected functions.

## Requirements
To run this program, you need to have Python installed along with the SymPy library. You can install SymPy using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using the command:
   ```bash
   python differentiation_program.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the type of differentiation you want to perform.

## Example
- To differentiate sin(x), select the option for trigonometric differentiation and choose sin(x).
- To perform implicit differentiation, enter an equation such as `x**2 + y**2 - 1`.
